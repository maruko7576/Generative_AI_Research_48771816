# Drafts_And_Reports
　Drafts_And_Reports contains draft manuscripts, completed original documents, etc.
# Additional_Materials
　Additional_Materials contains figures and tables.
# Literature_Review_documents
　Literature_Review_documents contains references.


Please avoid using spaces or special characters.
All filenames should follow this format:
　[Project][ContentType][AuthorInitials]_[DDMMYYYY]_v[VersionNumber].[ext]
　e.g., GAIStudy_InterviewTranscripts_KT_20250918_v01.docx
Please include the update date within the file. The date should be formatted as (DD/MM/YYYY).
